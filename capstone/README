## Description
This project displays cards of notable figures and allows users to view detailed information, "like" them, or delete entries. The data is fetched from a local server, and interactions with the API update the state of each person in real-time.
## Features
Fetch and display a list of people from the API.
Users can:
View each person’s biography and other details.
"Like" a person, which increments the like count and updates the server.
Delete a person, which removes them from the list and deletes their entry from the server.
Click on a person’s image to view a detailed preview.

## API Endpoints
GET /people: Fetch all people data.
PATCH /people/:id: Update a person’s likes.
DELETE /people/:id: Delete a person from the list.

## How to Use

The page will display a list of people with their images, biographies, and other details.
